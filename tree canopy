In Los Angeles County, the tree canopy plays a crucial role in enhancing the urban environment. Let's explore some relevant information:

1. Tree Canopy Coverage:
   - The Los Angeles County Tree Canopy Map Viewer provides an interactive map that displays existing and potential tree canopy coverage throughout the county. You can explore this map to understand the distribution of trees and their impact on various areas¬π¬≤.
   - Interestingly, in the City of LA, approximately 18% of the tree canopy exists in areas where only 1% of the population resides. These pockets of greenery are concentrated within just 5 census block groups, covering less than 8% of the total land area¬≥.

2. Tree Height:
   - While the specific height of individual trees varies, some common tree species found in Los Angeles County include:
     - Jacaranda: Known for its vibrant purple flowers during spring, jacarandas can reach heights of **30 to 50 feet**.
     - California Sycamore: These majestic trees can grow up to **80 feet** tall.
     - Coast Live Oak: A native oak species, coast live oaks can reach impressive heights of **40 to 60 feet**.
     - Chinese Elm: These trees typically grow to a height of **40 to 50 feet**.
   - Keep in mind that these heights are approximate and can vary based on factors such as soil conditions, climate, and maintenance‚Å¥.
